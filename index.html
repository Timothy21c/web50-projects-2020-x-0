		<p style="background-color:yellow;" class="screen-only">My name is Timothy C Onuzurike and I'm from Nigeria but Iâ€™ve been in the US since I was 10 years old and now, I am 21 years old. My interest since I was a kid was to become someone involved in the technology side. Initially, I wanted to become an electrician. As I grew up and moved to the United States, I learned more about other career fields and decided to become a hardware engineer. Then my uncle informed me that his daughter is a hardware engineer and she recommended that I should learn how to code because it is the job of the future.
		I did my own research and it turns out that she was right and when I tell people that my major was software development, they said that is the job to go for and I would get hired faster than hardware. That gave me more confident in my major in college. so, then, I discovered how to code and I liked it a lot. so, I switched to become a software developer and now, I change my mind to web developer because it is more flexible to instead of a fixed schedule
