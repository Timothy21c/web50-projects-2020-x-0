        <h1><h style='color:Green';> My Interests</h1>
		<p><p style='color:Tomato';> Now that you know a little bit more about me, You'll get to know me a little more. 
		<p>I currently go to school but because the Covid-19 pendamic, I'm doing online schooling. When I am not doing school work, i like to listen to music and play video games.
		<p style="color:blue;">Some of the games i like to play is Call of Duty Mobile, Last Day on Earth: Survivial, and Lords Mobile. I also like to play Tanki Online on my desktop while waiting fo the mobile version to released on iOS. It is currenty  released on andriod devices.
		<p style="color:SteelBlue;">You probably have never heard of Last Day on Earth: Survivial. The game setting is a post-zombie apocolypyse and the goal is to survive and gather resources to build your base and survive. Make weapons, armor or craft other items that will help you become stronger. When you are strong enough, you can explore dangerous locations that hold better loot to obtain.</p>
		<p>Maybe you have heard of Lords Mobile. It is basically a (Massively Multiplayer Online, Strategy and Role-playing video game)MMORPG. You build your castle, gather resources and upgrade your war gear to attack other castles and defend your castle.
